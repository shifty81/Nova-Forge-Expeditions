## Project Vision

EVE OFFLINE is a PVE-focused space MMO inspired by EVE Online, designed for small groups of players (2-20). The project aims to recreate the EVE Online experience with:
- C++ and OpenGL game engine with ECS architecture
- Server-authoritative multiplayer for cooperative gameplay
- EVE-like mechanics: ships, skills, fitting, combat, missions, exploration
- Fully moddable via editable JSON files
- Focus on PVE content without PVP stress
- AI-driven economy where NPCs are real economic actors
- Custom retained-mode UI system (replacing ImGui for game UI)
- Deterministic simulation for networking and replays

**What we are NOT building:**
- PvP combat
- Twitch shooter mechanics
- Asset-copied EVE clone
- Client-authoritative logic

## Master Implementation Plan

> Based on comprehensive baseline design document (February 2026) and `scopeforprojectsofar.rtf` project planning document

### Architecture Pillars

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Server (Authoritative)** | Tick-based simulation, ECS, AI, economy, combat, persistence |
| **Client (Display)** | Rendering, interpolation, UI, input, audio — no game logic authority |
| **Networking** | Server sends snapshots → Client caches → Interpolation → Render |

### Simulation Model
- **Tick-based** (10-20 Hz), not frame-based
- **Deterministic** logic for networking and replays
- All systems process on server ticks: Movement, Combat, Industry, AI, Market

### AI as Economic Actors (Critical for PvE)
AI NPCs are real participants in the economy, not fake spawn-and-die mobs:
- **Miners** — Choose asteroids, mine ore, haul to stations
- **Haulers** — Buy/sell on market, transport between stations
- **Industrialists** — Manufacture goods, respond to orders
- **Traders** — Market speculation, arbitrage
- **Pirates** — Disrupt trade routes, attack miners
- **Authorities** — Respond to security threats
- **Mercenaries** — Accept player contracts

Each AI owns ships, has a wallet, responds to market prices, and can die permanently. Player actions distort the economy: blow up haulers → prices spike; mine too much → prices crash.

### Economy Engine
- No fake NPC market orders — everything is produced, transported, consumed, destroyed
- Regional markets with delayed information
- Dynamic taxation and broker fees
- Shipping risk and supply/demand curves

### Custom UI Strategy (Replacing ImGui for Game UI)
- **Retained-mode** windowed UI system
- **Window docking** (DockNode tree with split/leaf nodes)
- **EVE-style dark theme** (defined in `data/ui/eve_dark_theme.json`)
- **Ship HUD**: Control ring (shield/armor/hull), capacitor bar, module rack, target brackets
- **Keyboard-first** interaction with mouse support
- **Data binding** via observer pattern (no polling)
- ImGui retained only for debug/dev tools

### Modular Procedural Ship Generation
- Ships generated from modular parts assembled along a hull spine
- **ShipSeed** struct: seed, faction, hull class, tech tier, role
- Same seed = same ship forever (networking + saves)
- Part families: Hull Spine, Bow/Nose, Stern/Engines, Mid Modules, Hardpoints
- Faction shape language drives silhouettes and materials
- Procedural materials (base color, edge wear, panel lines, grime, emissive)

### Ship HUD Architecture ("Cold Control Ring")
The Ship HUD is anchored bottom-center, designed for peripheral readability:
- **Control Ring**: Outer ring (shield), middle ring (armor), inner core (hull) — arc-based with clockwise depletion
- **Velocity Arc**: Speed indicator around control ring, color changes for boost/align/webbed states
- **Capacitor Bar**: Vertical bar with gradient from green (full) to red (critical)
- **Module Rack**: Horizontal row grouped by slot type (High/Mid/Low), 32×32 icons with cooldown sweeps
- **Target Brackets**: Four-corner brackets in space, color-coded by relation, lock progress arcs
- **Alert Stack**: Priority-based warnings above ring ("CAP LOW", "STRUCTURE CRITICAL", "SCRAMBLED")
- **Damage Feedback**: Shield (blue ripple), armor (yellow flash), hull (red pulse + shake)

### Combat Damage Layers
Shield → Armor → Hull damage progression:
- **Shield**: Regenerates over time, takes full damage, visual blue ripple effects
- **Armor**: No regen, reduced damage via resists, visual sparks and plating cracks
- **Hull**: No regen, critical effects below 25%, visual fires, smoke, flicker

### AI Combat Behavior Tiers
AI behavior scales by difficulty tier:
| Tier | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Civilian | Flee when engaged |
| Militia | Attack blindly |
| Navy | Maintain optimal range |
| Elite | Focus fire, coordinated |
| Boss | Spawns reinforcements |

AI state machine: Idle → Patrol → Engage → Orbit → Retreat

### Economy-Driven Ship Generation
NPC ships reflect economic state:
- Resource-rich systems → More mining ships with bulky hulls
- War-torn systems → Damaged ships, more combat patrols
- High-tech systems → Sleeker, advanced hulls
- Player actions (mining, piracy, trade protection) visibly change traffic patterns

### LOD & Impostor System
Performance scaling for large fleet battles:
| Distance | LOD Level | Update Rate |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| <5km | LOD0 (full detail) | 30 Hz |
| 5-20km | LOD1 (reduced segments) | 15 Hz |
| 20-80km | LOD2 (merged mesh) | 5 Hz |
| >80km | Impostor (billboard) | 1 Hz |

### Salvage & Wrecks System
Post-combat gameplay loop:
- Ship destruction → Wreck spawn with original ShipSeed
- Salvage value affected by: ship class, tech tier, damage type, overkill amount
- Wreck visuals: damaged ship impostor, broken modules floating, fire slowly extinguishing
- Salvage gameplay: target wreck, activate salvager, progress bar, RNG roll influenced by skills

### Overview & Targeting Integration
EVE-style targeting system:
- Overview is a filtered ECS query of Targetable entities, sorted by distance/threat
- Click overview row or in-space bracket → synced EntityID selection
- Lock time = function of target signature and player sensor strength
- Weapon fire auto-aims to locked target

### Mod Support Architecture
Data-driven modding without code injection:
- `ai_profiles.json`: Define AI behavior (orbitRange, retreatThreshold, focusFire)
- `economy_rules.json`: Define system economy curves (pirateSpawnRate, miningYield)
- `ship_templates.json`: Define ship stats and visual parameters
- All mods maintain deterministic simulation
