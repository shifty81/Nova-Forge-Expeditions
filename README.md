**Nova-Forge: Expeditions** is a tri-modal (FPS + Flight + Fleet Command) space simulation game built
on the Atlas Engine — a modular, deterministic C++20 game engine. This repo is the final unified
iteration base, combining the best of all three predecessor repositories.

## Development Status

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the complete 7-phase roadmap. Current state:

| Phase | Area | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| A | Dev Infrastructure & Code Health | 🔧 40% complete |
| B | GUI System Hardening & Expansion | 📋 Foundation done, expansion planned |
| C | PCG Expansion & Refinement | 📋 Foundation done, expansion planned |
| D | AtlasForgeAI Integration | 📋 HttpLLMBackend done, full agent loop planned |
| E | Cross-System Integration | 📋 Planned |
| F | Advanced Cinematic & Visualization | 📋 Planned |
| G | Experimental & Futuristic | 📋 Long horizon |

**Game features begin after Milestone 7** — engine, tooling, and AI must be production-solid first.

### Known Issues from Merge (see [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md))

1. `cpp_common/` is not yet wired into CMakeLists link graph
2. `cpp_server/src/systems/` needs SingleComponentSystem template re-migration (Phase A1)
3. `GameSession` has two parallel decompositions (`game_session_*.cpp` vs `handlers/`) — needs consolidation
4. `engine/tools/` and `editor/` have overlapping tool implementations — needs namespacing
5. 5 new AtlasForge test files not yet registered in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`
6. `engine/render/` has dual implementations (AtlasForge standalone vs ANF integrated)

- ✅ Project system with schema-validated `.atlas` files
- ✅ World generation (cube-sphere, voxel, terrain, galaxy, noise, streaming)
- ✅ TLA+ formal specifications and CI determinism gate

**Nova Forge Server (537 C++ files, 164 game systems)**

- **Client Integration** — Wiring all server systems to C++ client rendering and UI

### What's Planned

- **Editor Conversion** — Convert standalone AtlasEditor to in-game ToolingLayer with EditorCommandBus (see [docs/EDITOR_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](docs/EDITOR_CONVERSION_PLAN.md))
- **FPS + Flight + Fleet Command** — Tri-modal gameplay with PlayerModeController and hard mode boundaries (see [docs/GAME_DESIGN_VISION.md](docs/GAME_DESIGN_VISION.md))
- **Legend System** — Player reputation driving world bias across runs
- **Procedural FPS Interiors** — Low-poly style with grammar-based room generation

## Architecture

The project has two major layers:

### Atlas Engine (Core)

Shared engine library powering all executables:

| Binary          | Purpose                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `AtlasEditor`   | Full editor + runtime (superset)              |
| `AtlasRuntime`  | Standalone runtime with CLI project loading   |
| `AtlasClient`   | Player runtime                                |
| `AtlasServer`   | Headless authoritative server                 |

### Nova Forge (Game)

PvE space simulator built on Atlas Engine:

| Binary              | Purpose                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `nova_forge_server` | Authoritative game server (tick-based sim) |
| `nova_forge_client` | Player client (rendering, UI, audio)       |

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Engine Core** | ECS, Graph VM, determinism, assets, networking foundations |
| **Server (Authoritative)** | Tick-based simulation, AI, economy, combat, persistence |
| **Client (Display)** | Rendering, interpolation, UI, input, audio — no game logic authority |
| **ToolingLayer (Planned)** | In-game editor overlay, command bus, live editing |

```bash
# Build all targets in Release mode
./build.sh

# Build specific targets
./build.sh server client          # Server and client only
./build.sh editor                 # Developer client (editor) only

./build.sh --test        # Via build script
cd build && ctest        # Or manually
```

## Core Design Principles

1. **Engine Is Not a Game** — The engine contains no gameplay logic; all behavior is data
2. **Everything Is Data** — All behavior is authored as assets and executable graphs
3. **One Engine, Four Roles** — Editor, Runtime, Client, and Server share the same core
4. **Determinism First** — All simulation is deterministic for networking and replay
5. **Editor Becomes Tooling** — Editor converts to in-game ToolingLayer, not a separate application
6. **Graphs Everywhere** — 14+ domain-specific graph types power world gen, AI, animation, and more

## Graph Systems

Atlas uses a DAG-based graph execution model across many domains:

| Graph Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| WorldGraph | Procedural terrain and world generation |
| StrategyGraph | AI strategy decisions (influence, threat) |
| ConversationGraph | Dialogue and NPC memory |
| BehaviorGraph | Authorable AI behavior trees |
| AnimationGraph | Animation state machines with modifiers |
| CharacterGraph | Modular character generation |
| WeaponGraph | Weapon construction and wear |
| TileGraph | 2D procedural tile maps |
| SoundGraph | Procedural audio synthesis |
| UIGraph | UI composition (panels, buttons, layouts) |
| UIScreenGraph | Screen-level UI management |
| GameFlowGraph | Game state flow (boot → credits) |
| StoryGraph | Narrative generation and branching |
| AssetGraph | Asset pipeline execution |
