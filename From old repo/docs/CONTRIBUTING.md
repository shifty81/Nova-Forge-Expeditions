- **Environment details** (OS, compiler version, etc.)
- **Screenshots** if applicable

### 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please:

- Check the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) first
- Search existing issues for similar suggestions
- Provide clear use cases and benefits
- Consider implementation complexity

### 📝 Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always appreciated:

- Fix typos or clarify confusing sections
- Add examples or tutorials
- Update outdated information
- Improve organization

### 🎨 Adding Content

The easiest way to contribute is by adding game content:

#### Ships
Add new ship definitions in `data/ships/`:
```json
{
  "ship_id": {
    "name": "Ship Name",
    "class": "Frigate",
    "hull_hp": 500,
    "armor_hp": 400,
    "shield_hp": 600,
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Modules
Add new modules in `data/modules/`:
```json
{
  "module_id": {
    "name": "Module Name",
    "type": "weapon",
    "slot": "high",
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Missions
Add new missions in `data/missions/`:
```json
{
  "mission_id": {
    "name": "Mission Name",
    "level": 1,
    "type": "combat",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Atlas-EveOffline.git
cd Atlas-EveOffline
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Linux/macOS — install deps and build
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev \
  libglfw3-dev libglm-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libopenal-dev libfreetype-dev
./scripts/build_project.sh

# Windows — see docs/guides/VS2022_SETUP_GUIDE.md
scripts\build_project.bat Release all

# Run tests to verify setup
./scripts/build_project.sh Release test
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

---

## Development Process

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep changes focused and minimal

### 2. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Build and run all tests
./scripts/build_project.sh Release test

# Build specific targets
./scripts/build_project.sh Release engine     # Engine only
./scripts/build_project.sh Release client     # Client only
./scripts/build_project.sh Release server     # Server only

# Validate project structure
./scripts/build_project.sh Release validate

# Or use Make shortcuts
make build
make test
```

### 3. Update Documentation

- Update relevant docs in `docs/` folder
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update README.md if needed

---

## Style Guidelines

### C++ Code

Follow the [Atlas Naming Conventions](../ATLAS_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md):

```cpp
// Use PascalCase for classes, types, and components
// Use PascalCase + "System" suffix for ECS systems
// Use snake_case for file names
// Use camelCase for local variables and function parameters
// Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants and enums

class HealthComponent {
public:
    float currentHP = 100.0f;
    float maxHP = 100.0f;
};

class DamageSystem {
public:
    /// Apply damage to an entity with the given damage type.
    void applyDamage(Entity target, float amount, DamageType type);
};
```

### JSON Data Files

Use consistent formatting:

```json
{
  "entity_id": {
    "name": "Entity Name",
    "property": value,
    "nested": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

- Use 2-space indentation
- Use double quotes
- Keep IDs lowercase with underscores
- Group related properties together

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Add code examples where helpful
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 chars)

---

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

### Format

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what changed and why, not how.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
```

### Examples

Good:
```
Add manufacturing system with blueprint research

Implements ME/TE research, manufacturing queue, and blueprint
copying mechanics. Includes tests and documentation.
```

Bad:
```
Fixed stuff
```
